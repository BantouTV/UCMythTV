The module in this directory forms the example reference implementation of a
fully compliant Universal Control Server. Not all of the optional features
of a Universal Control Server are implemented, but most are, and those which
are not can be implemented easily by reference to those which are.

This module serves as a library which can be loaded by a programme to create
a UC Server with. It represents the core UC server functionality. Adaptation
code must be created for use with this library in order to create a fully
functioning UC server that can query and control a particular underlying
media hardware/software system.

This software is provided for example purposes only, and we provide no guarantee of it being free from bugs. We do not recommend its use in any mission-critical environments.
