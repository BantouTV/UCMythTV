This module provides a simple extension to python's BaseHTTPServer module to
include HTTP 1.1 digest authentication. It is fully documented in pydoc.

This software is provided for example purposes only, and we provide no guarantee of it being free from bugs. We do not recommend its use in any mission-critical environments.

The modules installed are:
 -- HTTPAuthenticationServer (the actual server module)

and, if hashlib is not present on your system then also:

 -- md5py (a pure python implementation of the md5 algorithm)
