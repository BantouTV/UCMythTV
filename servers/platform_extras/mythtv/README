This directory contains the code and patches for building the modified
version of MythTV required at present (Feb 2011) for the Universal Control
Server.

See INSTALL file in the great-grandparent directory for details of how to do
this process.

Assuming you already have, if you just want to regenerate the binary
tarball, run:

   ./recreate-tarball.sh
