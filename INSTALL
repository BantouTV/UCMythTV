The instructions here cover:

 * how to build the required customised MythTV instance
 * how to build a distribution tarball including both it and UC Server
 * how to create a USB stick from which MythBuntu can be installed
   that includes the MythTV + UC server tarball
 * how to set up a machine from scratch using that USB stick
 * how to later install just UC server (eg. if a new version)

At present (Feb 2011) UC Server requires a slightly patched version of
MythTV. Installation therefore requires the building of a customised
build of MythTV.

The authors have successfully done this using:

 MythBuntu 10.04 (32 bit edition)

This was used becuase, being a MythTV oriented distribution, it already
comes with many of the required packages for MythTV and automates much of
the process needed to get MythTV up and running.

The steps below assume your MythTV system has a DVB-T TV Tuner connected
eg. a USB based TV tuner device. If you live in a country without DVB-T
then this process should still work for other kinds of digital TV. The
steps you need to take during the part of the myth tv setup process
where you configure and tune the TV receiver, may need to be varied as
appropriate.



Obtaining MythTV source, patching it and compiling it
-----------------------------------------------------

The following steps should be followed in order to build the modified
MythTV that is needed, at present, by the Universal Control server code.
This process downloads the MythTV source, patches it, compiles it, then
builds an installation tarball.

   1. Download a MythBuntu installer image from Mythbuntu and write it to a
      USB stick as a bootable disk.

   2. Execute the following commands (you will need 'git' and 'patch'
      installed for this to work):

          cd servers/platform_extras/mythtv
          ./scripts/acquire-mythtv-source.sh

      The source-code for MythTV itself can now be found in this directory:

          servers/platform_extras/mythtv/mythtv-source

      and can be modified and worked with as desired. This directory is a
      git repository holding the code of the system.

   3. You will also need to install some missing dependencies if you don't
      already have them. This can be done as follows on a debian based
      distro such as MythBuntu:

          sudo apt-get install build-essential libasound2-dev libqt4-dev \
                               pkg-config yasm libdirectfb-dev g++ \
                               qt4-qmake libmp3lame-dev libxxf86vm-dev \
                               libxinerama-dev python-pycurl

   4. To create an updated binary tarball with your modified version of
      MythTV run:

          cd servers/platform_extras/mythtv
          ./recreate-tarball.sh

You can now move onto the installation steps described below.




Creating an installation USB stick
----------------------------------

These steps assume you have followed the previous instructions and have,
preared, a tarball of the patched and compiled MythTV ready for install.

These steps show you how to create a USB stick with MythBuntu on it,
ready to install MythBuntu onto a new PC; but also including the
UC server code, and our patched version of MythTV, ready to be easily
installed once MythBuntu installation is complete.

On your development machine (not the target machine), to make an
installation USB stick:

   1. Download a Mythbuntu installer image from Mythbuntu and write it to a
      USB stick as a bootable disk. Choose the 10.04 32 bit edition.

   2. Change directory to the repository trunk root then execute the
      following commands:

          cd scripts
          ./package-dist-mythtv.sh create

      This packages up both the mythtv tarball and all the components
      that make up the UC Server into a single tarball with an installation
      script.

   3. Copy the resulting tarball UC-confluence-mythtv-install-[date].tar.gz
      from the ../dist directory also onto the USB stick



Setting up a new PC with the USB stick you just created
-------------------------------------------------------

For each target machine you want to install on:

   1. Boot your new computer using the USB stick and start the MythBuntu
      installation process.

   2. When the installer asks you if you want to run the mythtv
      configuration tools say yes, and then do the following:

         1. Add a capture card - 'DVB DTV capture card' for DVB receivers

         2. Add a Video Source, setting the 'listings grabber' to
           'Transmitted guide only (EIT)'

         3. Configure an "Input Mapping" between the DVB receiver you
            configured and the Video Source you created, and then tell
            it to scan for all channels (TV and radio)

         4. Accept all of the channels it finds

         5. optionally edit your channel table to remove channels you don't
            want to use.

   3. Finish the MythBuntu instalation and allow the machine to reboot
      into MythBuntu

   4. Quit the MythTV frontend by pressing Esc at the main menu.

   5. Open up a terminal, mount the usb stick, copy the tarball you created
      before across, and uncompress it.

   6. Change into the uncompressed directory and execute the command:

          bash setup.sh

   7. Enter the password of your user account when prompted. The target
      machine must be on a direct internet connection (no proxies) at
      the time.

   8. After a few minutes, the mythtv frontend will start.
      Confirm that you wish to perform upgrade, and reconfirm when a warning
      is displayed.

   9. Exit the mythtv frontend. The machine will then reboot and
      installation should be complete.

Finally: the distribution also includes a script for enabling audio via HDMI
which was developed use on Asus 'EeeBox' PCs. To use it, run:

        scripts/enable_hdmi_audio.sh




Installing/updating just the UC Server
--------------------------------------

Perhaps you just want to update the UC Server, without re-installing the
modified MythTV too:

    1. Go into the scripts directory and run these two scripts:

            package-server-mythtv.sh
            package-server-lib-py-ucserver.sh

       If successful, each will echo the path to a resulting tarball,
       containing the packaged code.

    2. Take the two tarballs, copy them onto the target machine, uncompress
       them, and for both, run:

            sudo python setup.py install
