The Universal Control (UC) API is a RESTful Web API designed to allow the
core functionality of any network-connected set-top box, personal video
recorder, Internet radio or similar device to be controlled from client
software running on another device on the home network.

The protocol is specified in BBC R&D White Paper 194:

< http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/publications/whitepaper194.shtml >

The idea is that a TV/set-top-box runs a UC server that implements the API.
And client devices communicate with the TV/set-top-box via that API. Because
it is a web based API, clients could be anything from a mobile phone app, to
javascript within a web page.

The code here are prototype implementations of Universal Control API clients
and servers:

 * A MythTV based prototype server
 * Prototype client(s)

This software is provided for example purposes only, and we provide no guarantee of it being free from bugs. We do not recommend its use in any mission-critical environments.



Getting started
---------------

The prototype server adds a UC API server implementation to MythTV. It
requires a slightly customised (patched) build of MythTV at present. See
the INSTALL file for detailed instructions on how to get it up and running.

The client is a simple web based client that requires no installation
process. See the README file in its directory.

There are also some utilities - such as a tool for creating and decoding
'pairing codes'.
